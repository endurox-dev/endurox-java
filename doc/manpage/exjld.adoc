NAME
----
exjld - Java Binary Linker tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*exjld* ['OPTIONS'] JAR...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*exjld* is Enduro/X java linker too. The tool is used to compile given jar files
into single executable binary. *exjld* basically extracts all jar files, converts
them to C resources (statically initialized byte arrays). These byte array
global variables are indexed by class names. The application then is started by
custom class loader which from JNI side pulls is the classes necessary. Basically
by using this tool, the developer can distributed java programs with zero dependencies,
except the fact that JDK and Enduro/X libraries must be installed on system.
All other depended JARs are compiled statically into single executable. This
can greatly help to improve product development and streamline the product
delivery to the customer. As the all logic is encapsulated into autonomous binary.
Thus at the production, the target system can be composed of different such kind
of binaries, where each of them can depend on different set or version of the
third party Jar libs.

*exjld* must have access to *cc* (C Compiler). *exjld* by default calls Enduro/X
*buildserver* utility used for compiling sources and linking with Enduro/X libs.
Also program uses *jar* tool for extracting the jar files. The class files to
C resources are converted by *exembedfile(8)* utility.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*CC*::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

*CFLAGS*::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *buildclient* execution.

OPTIONS
-------
[*-L* 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH']::
Additional library path for dynamic libraries. This is needed during the compiled
code execution, so that runtime can load dynamic libraries required by Enduro/X.

[*-b* 'BUILD_FLAGS']::
Additional flags to be passed to 'cc' command line. This can be used to pass
additional include path, library path or libraries it self.

[*-n*]::
Do not process UBF mapping during compilation of the view file. This can be useful
in cases if the environment is not configured during the build time and field
definition files are not accessible at the time.

[*-d* 'OUTPUT_DIRECTOR']::
Optional flag for changing output directory where object file is generated. If
parameter is not set, current directory is used.

[*-C*]::
Reserved for future use.

[*-m* 'LANGUAGE_MODE']::
Language mode for header file generation. Currently defined value is 0 - C lang,
which is default value of the parameter.

[*-h*]::
Print usage.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
