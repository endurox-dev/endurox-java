NAME
----
exjld - Java Binary Linker tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*exjld* ['OPTIONS'] JAR...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*exjld* is Enduro/X Java linker too. The tool is used to compile given jar files
into single executable binary. *exjld* basically extracts all jar files, converts
them to C resources (statically initialized byte arrays). These byte array
global variables are indexed by class names. The application then is started by
custom class loader which from JNI side pulls is the classes necessary. Basically
by using this tool, the developer can distributed Java programs with zero dependencies,
except the fact that JDK and Enduro/X libraries must be installed on system.
All other depended JARs are compiled statically into single executable. This
can greatly help to improve product development and streamline the product
delivery to the customer. As the all logic is encapsulated into autonomous binary.
Thus at the production, the target system can be composed of different such kind
of binaries, where each of them can depend on different set or version of the
third party Jar libs.

*exjld* linker normally links the binary two times. First time it does the test
when class loader is instructed to load main class. If loading succeed, then
linker re-links the binary with the final mode which includes the execution of
the main class after it is loader.

*exjld* must have access to *cc* (C Compiler). *exjld* by default calls Enduro/X
*buildserver* utility used for compiling sources and linking with Enduro/X libs.
Also program uses *jar* tool for extracting the jar files. The class files to
C resources are converted by *exembedfile(8)* utility.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*CC*::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

*CFLAGS*::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *buildserver* execution.

*NDRX_HOME*::
Optional Enduro/X home directory, where to search for the *include* sub-folder
and library folder.

OPTIONS
-------

*JAR*::
This is list of JAR files that must be linked into binary.

*-m* 'MAIN_CLASS_NAME'::
This is main class name into which executable will enter after the process is
started.

[*-o* 'OUTPUT_BINARY']::
This is name of output binary.If not specified then *a.out* is used.

[*-l* 'LINK_LIBRARIES']::
Additional shared/static C libraries that shall be linked with the process. The
'-l' argument can be repeated multiple times. The list of libraries are passed
down to the *buildserver* (or alternative) tool into format of C style libs
string.

[*-L* 'LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATH]::
This is link time (and also used for test runtime) the path where to search for
libraries used by compiler. Either it is path of static or dynamic libraries.
Can be repeated multiple times.

[*-I* 'INCLUDE_PATH']::
This is path where C compiler shall search for C include headers. Can be repeated
multiple times.

[*-b* 'BUILD_COMMAND']::
This is override of the C build command, which by default is Enduro/X's 
*buildserver*.

[*-n*]::
Do not perform test run of the main class loader.

[*-t* 'TEMP_DIR_PREFIX']::
The default prefix of temp dir (where JARs are extracted) is './'. With this
parameter other directory can be chosen.

[*-e* 'EMBED_RESOURCES']::
Additional resource files that can be accessible via Enduro/X Java API.

[*-h*]::
Print usage.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
