NAME
----
libexjava - Enduro/X XATMI Java binding glue code


SYNOPSIS
--------
libexjava.so
libexjava.dylib


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This library provides core functionality of the Enduro/X Java binding. It implements
the actual logic for Java JNI native calls to be translated to Enduro/X API.
Library provides functionality for XATMI clients, where the calls are only directed
from Java to XATMI and also provides functionality for XATMI servers, where the
initial "AtmiCtx.tprun()" is called and once service is called, the call is
redirected back to Java side where call is mapped to specific interface/object
where is being invoked, so for servers it gets Java -> C -> Java chain of calls.

Library provides and access to XA distributed transactions functionality. Firstly
calls are being to translated to *tpopen(3)*, *tpbegin(3)*, etc. But secondly,
the library provides an XA Switch for JDBC libraries. Thus developers can use
JDBC drivers to use two phase commit with Enduro/X. For such setup 
*NDRX_XA_RMLIB* is set to *libexjava.so* (or corresponding counterpart) and
*NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB* is set to *libndrxxajdbc.so*. When Java process performs
the XA init, the *libexjava.so* is not loaded twice. In case if *tmsrv(8)* is
configured with JDBC driver, then *libexjava.so* is loaded, jvm is started 
and *ndrxj_xa_init()* is called.

Library provides all buffer format accesses like UBF, JSON, STRING, etc and XATMI
APIs, logging APIs.

When java loads the JNI library it loads *libexjavald(8)* lib which in turn
globally loads the *libexjava*.
