== Intro

This document is for internal purposes of the Enduro/X Java module developer.
It contains solutions for main pitfalls found during the development process.
Also document contains main configuration steps to get the development IDE
working.

== NetBeans configuration

For Enduro/X and other related modules, NetBeans is preferred IDE for development.
As module is programmed in Java and C languages, two projects in NetBeans are
required. As NetBeans does not allow to project to co-exist in the same folder,
some play with symbolic links into separate folder are required. This document
will guide you for setting up the environment for developing Enduro/X for Java.

=== Packages for Java

This document assumes that NetBeans for C/C++ are installed. Thus to get
Java projects working, following additional plugins must be installed. As
plugins require JDK to be present for NetBeans, the IDE must be started with
'--jdkhome' attribute. In particular case NetBeans 8.2 was installed on Linux Mint
Mate 19 as a root. For this document we will use "java-8-openjdk-amd64".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$  /usr/local/netbeans-8.2/bin/netbeans --jdkhome /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once NetBeans are started, go to: *Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins* and select
following ones for install:

== Checking out Enduro/X Java project

With this step we will prepare two folders for the project. The first one is
default project folder "endurox-java" checked out from source repository. The
second one (which will be actually used by Java part for NetBeans) is created.
And symbolic links are added

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ git clone https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox-java
$ mkdir endurox-j
$ cd endurox-j
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/build.xml .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/tests .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/libsrc .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Opening projects in NetBeans

The main project is "endurox-java" which is processed by CMake. The CMake build
performs building of all parts Java and C. But for IDE we open this project for
as the C project.
