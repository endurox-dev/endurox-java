== Intro

This document is for internal purposes of the Enduro/X Java module developer.
It contains solutions for main pitfalls found during the development process.
Also document contains main configuration steps to get the development IDE
working.

== NetBeans configuration

For Enduro/X and other related modules, NetBeans is preferred IDE for development.
As module is programmed in Java and C languages, two projects in NetBeans are
required. As NetBeans does not allow to project to co-exist in the same folder,
some play with symbolic links into separate folder are required. This document
will guide you for setting up the environment for developing Enduro/X for Java.

=== Packages for Java

This document assumes that NetBeans for C/C++ are installed. Thus to get
Java projects working, following additional plugins must be installed. As
plugins require JDK to be present for NetBeans, the IDE must be started with
'--jdkhome' attribute. In particular case NetBeans 8.2 was installed on Linux Mint
Mate 19 as a root. For this document we will use "java-8-openjdk-amd64".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$  /usr/local/netbeans-8.2/bin/netbeans --jdkhome /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once NetBeans are started, go to: *Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins* and select
following ones for install:

Once modules are installed, it is recommended to update the NetBeans launcher 
shortcut, because the jdkhome argument is mandatory in order to use java projects

== Checking out Enduro/X Java project

With this step we will prepare two folders for the project. The first one is
default project folder "endurox-java" checked out from source repository. The
second one (which will be actually used by Java part for NetBeans) is created.
And symbolic links are added

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ git clone https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox-java
$ mkdir endurox-j
$ cd endurox-j
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/build.xml .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/tests .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/libsrc .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Opening projects in NetBeans

The main project is "endurox-java" which is processed by CMake. The CMake build
performs building of all parts Java and C. But for IDE we open this project for
as the C project.

=== Opening C project in NetBeans
Before opening the project in NetBeans, the cmake shall be run from shell, so
that it performs initial configuration, as with NetBeans the configuration
is little bit different:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ cd endurox-java
$ cmake .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this step is done, start the NetBeans, and create new project with existing
source code:

And then select the folder which checked out sources:

image:images/select_c_sources.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title="Select sources"]

=== Opening Java project in NetBeans

The Java project shall be based on folder where symlinks are produced. That is
"endurox-j" folder. The project type is "Standard" Java free-form project. The
project contains an Ant script which is not normally used for build purposes, but
that is used for NetBeans (or Eclipse) to parse the project structure (CMake
is not supported yet for Java projects). Also during the development the
ant script (endurox-java/build.xml) must be maintained.

Create a new project:

image:images/new_java_project.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title="New Java Project"]


Select project folder:

image:images/select_java_folder.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title="Select Java folder"]

Ant commands:

image:images/ant_commands.png[caption="Figure 6: ", title="Ant commands"]

Ant next screen is significant one, as here all Java directories must be manually
added, as the libsrc only is added by default. All unit tests which will be
changed/added during the development must be added here:

image:images/java_sources.png[caption="Figure 7: ", title="Java sources"]

Once project is created, this list can be altered in 
*project properties > Java Sources*

Also the class path shall include the Junit JARS. The next screen shows how
to do it when project is configured, but that can be done during the initial
wizard too.

The class path attributes:
