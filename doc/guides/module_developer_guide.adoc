== Intro

This document is for internal purposes of the Enduro/X Java module developer.
It contains solutions for main pitfalls found during the development process.
Also document contains main configuration steps to get the development IDE
working.

== NetBeans configuration

For Enduro/X and other related modules, NetBeans is preferred IDE for development.
As module is programmed in Java and C languages, two projects in NetBeans are
required. As NetBeans does not allow to project to co-exist in the same folder,
some play with symbolic links into separate folder are required. This document
will guide you for setting up the environment for developing Enduro/X for Java.

=== Packages for Java

This document assumes that NetBeans for C/C++ are installed. Thus to get
Java projects working, following additional plugins must be installed. As
plugins require JDK to be present for NetBeans, the IDE must be started with
'--jdkhome' attribute. In particular case NetBeans 8.2 was installed on Linux Mint
Mate 19 as a root. For this document we will use "java-8-openjdk-amd64".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$  /usr/local/netbeans-8.2/bin/netbeans --jdkhome /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once NetBeans are started, go to: *Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins* and select
following ones for install:

Once modules are installed, it is recommended to update the NetBeans launcher 
shortcut, because the jdkhome argument is mandatory in order to use java projects

== Checking out Enduro/X Java project

With this step we will prepare two folders for the project. The first one is
default project folder "endurox-java" checked out from source repository. The
second one (which will be actually used by Java part for NetBeans) is created.
And symbolic links are added

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ git clone https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox-java
$ mkdir endurox-j
$ cd endurox-j
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/build.xml .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/tests .
$ ln -s ../endurox-java/libsrc .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Opening projects in NetBeans

The main project is "endurox-java" which is processed by CMake. The CMake build
performs building of all parts Java and C. But for IDE we open this project for
as the C project.

=== Opening C project in NetBeans
Before opening the project in NetBeans, the cmake shall be run from shell, so
that it performs initial configuration, as with NetBeans the configuration
is little bit different:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ cd endurox-java
$ cmake .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this step is done, start the NetBeans, and create new project with existing
source code:

image:images/new_c_project.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title="New C Project"]

And then select the folder which checked out sources:

image:images/select_c_sources.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title="Select sources"]

=== Opening Java project in NetBeans

The Java project shall be based on folder where symlinks are produced. That is
"endurox-j" folder. The project type is "Standard" Java free-form project. The
project contains an Ant script which is not normally used for build purposes, but
that is used for NetBeans (or Eclipse) to parse the project structure (CMake
is not supported yet for Java projects). Also during the development the
ant script (endurox-java/build.xml) must be maintained.

Create a new project:

image:images/new_java_project.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title="New Java Project"]


Select project folder:

image:images/select_java_folder.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title="Select Java folder"]

Ant commands:

image:images/ant_commands.png[caption="Figure 6: ", title="Ant commands"]

Ant next screen is significant one, as here all Java directories must be manually
added, as the libsrc only is added by default. All unit tests which will be
changed/added during the development must be added here:

image:images/java_sources.png[caption="Figure 7: ", title="Java sources"]

Once project is created, this list can be altered in 
*project properties > Java Sources*

Also the class path shall include the Junit JARS. The next screen shows how
to do it when project is configured, but that can be done during the initial
wizard too.

If adding new sources folder get similar message like this 
(Package folder already used in project):

image:images/java_classpath.png[caption="Figure 8: ", title="Java source error"]

Then this probably is caused by "endurox-java" C project. There is nothing to
do in such case except to go and manually edit the NetBeans project file in

*endurox-j/nbproject/project.xml* and add the necessary source folders to project,
in similar way as other source folders are added.


*The class path attributes*:

== Distributed transaction processing architecture

The nice thing about Java is that their JDBC drivers, are that they provide
two phase commit interfaces. The basic principle for the operations are the
same which are used by X/Open XA interface. See 
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/transaction/xa/XAResource.html.

Enduro/X by it self uses following architecture for the XA two phase transactions,
thus bindings added to Java shall support XA transactions too. There are known
"standard" java APIs for this like JTA, but Enduro/X brings as close as possible
XATMI API To Java, thus transactions are managed by XATMI API, which basically
consists of following methods:

- AtmiCtx.tpopen - Configure resource manager, create instance of XAResource
and XAConnection associated with ATMI Context

- AtmiCtx.tpclose - Disconnect from resource manager, delete XAResource and
XAConnection associated with ATMI Context

- AtmiCtx.tpbegin - Start the transaction

- AtmiCtx.tpsuspend - Suspend current transaction, put context outside of any
transaction

- AtmiCtx.tpresume - Resume suspend transaction, put context back into global
transaction

- AtmiCtx.tpcommit - Commit the transaction

- AtmiCtx.tpabort - Abort current transaction

- AtmiCtx.getConnection - get connect object from XAConnection. The pooling and 
closing of connection shall done by programmer.


The object hierarchy is as follows:

>>>> Object relactions here <<<

The transaction management, communications with transaction manager (Enduro/X
*tmsrv* binary are performed by Enduro/X C libraries, but due to fact that
JDBC drivers live in Java side, the callbacks from C are done back to Java.
To get things more complex, Enduro/X uses standard approach of loading XA drivers
from C side shared library. Once Enduro/X Core together with Java modules are
booted, they are not aware of users willing to use JDBC, in fact Enduro/X Core
does not know anything about JDBC. But Enduro/X Java module provides special
library named "libndrxxajdbc.so" (our corresponding  counter part for MacOS),
which in turn expects in "NDRX_XA_RMLIB" (resource managers) configuration
parameter expects "libexjava.so" to set. The libexjava.so provides handler
to resolve the XA Switch. At startup static XADataSource is initialized. The
initialization is done by parsing JSON configuration string found in *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR*.
The syntax for Open String is following

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


{"class":"<JDBC Driver Class Name>", 
        "set": {
                "<Set Method Of Class Object 1>":"<Value to bet set 1>"
                ,"<Set Method Of Class Object 2>":"<Value to bet set 2>"
                ,"<Set Method Of Class Object N>":"<Value to bet set N>"
                ,"<Set Method of Properties 1": {
                        "<Property 1 Setting 1>":"<Value to bet set 1/1>"
                        "<Property 1 Setting N>":"<Value to bet set 1/N>"
                    }
                }
        }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thing is that Configuration of XA JDBC Drivers are not standard. There is no
standard set of XADataSource methods to configure the driver. Thus Enduro/X uses
generic approach to create driver instance and configure it via JSON configuration
string. This string accepts:

1. Class name (NOTE! The JDBC driver must be loaded either via linkage or by 
classpath)

2. A group of set method names and their values. The value types accepted are:
*Short*, *Long*, *Integer*, *Byte*, *Float*, *Double*, *Boolean*, *String*. The
values for these data types are parsed as strings.

3. An setter method accepting *java.util.Properties*, accepts JSON sub-objects
with the same set of parameters described in 2.

And example of XA Open String is following (used by Oracle thin JDBC Driver):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[@global/DB1_JDBC]
NDRX_XA_RES_ID=1
NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR={"class":"oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource", 
        "set": {
                "setUser":"${EX_ORA_USER}"
                ,"setPassword":"${EX_ORA_PASS}"
                ,"setURL":"jdbc:oracle:thin:@${EX_ORA_HOST}:${EX_ORA_PORT}/${EX_ORA_SID}"
                }
        }
NDRX_XA_CLOSE_STR=${NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR}
NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB=${NDRX_APPHOME}/../../xadrv/libndrxxajdbc.so
NDRX_XA_RMLIB=${NDRX_APPHOME}/../../libsrc/c/libexjava.so
NDRX_XA_LAZY_INIT=1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The XADataSource is configured during the XATMI Startup or during the first
XA call (if lazy init is used).

Overall the library dependencies can be seen in following diagram:
